# Passenger Integration Frontend

Open `index.html` directly in your browser (works with the FastAPI backend on http://localhost:8000).
If your browser blocks fetch from file://, serve a tiny local server:

# from frontend/
python -m http.server 5500

Then open http://localhost:5500 in your browser.
